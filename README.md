# AI-Powered-Insurance-Claim-Processing-with-Generative-AI

Project Description:
Developed an AI-driven insurance claim processing system leveraging Generative AI to enhance fraud detection, claim validation, and automated risk assessment. The system integrates Gork and Together.ai models for real-time policy understanding and anomaly detection, reducing false claim approvals by 40%.

Using RAG techniques, the system dynamically retrieves and processes relevant insurance policies, enhancing decision-making accuracy. A multi-agent LLM framework built with LangChain enables interactive AI-powered underwriting, reducing manual review efforts by 60%.

Deployed on AWS Bedrock and SageMaker, the AI pipeline seamlessly integrates into existing insurance workflows, ensuring secure, scalable, and high-performance operations. The project also features automated explainability reports for compliance audits, utilizing LlamaIndex and vector databases for transparent AI-driven decisions.
